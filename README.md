# GA
Genetic Algoritem developing and implementing
This is an exersize of solution implementation in the "real world" problem.
the problem: how much to manufacture in each period, given a storage cost demands and other parameters perperiod.
While The main target is to minimize costs: storage and manufacturing.
See a full detailed example in the readme.pdf file (heb) or in the code file: "main.c" (eng.)
As Explained it is not a simple problem at all.
the amount of itteratives needed is t! where t is the number of periods in the planning issue.
t! posebilities to check can not be solved in "normal" time, using current technology's.

Here comes GA, wich is Metha-heyursic algorithm, based on biologocal idea - the evulution.
The basic philosophy is that human race (or any other living entities) survival contains the methos it self.
It means that the  surviving vital GENs some how "know" to pass their way all over the generations.
In accordance with that, we can try to think about the solution (of the problem mentioned above) as if it was 
a CHROMOSOM.
Thus the algorithm models the process into computer functions, structures and statistics.


NOTEs:
- The program developed with C language in visual studio code editor and .gcc compiler.
- The project is an exersize for learning purpuse only. I'll be happy to receive questions and comments.
